# Quasar Barcode Generator by KDJ (quasar-barcode-generator)
When I was developing an asset management using Quasar Framework, I got a requirment from my client to generate Barcodes. However, when I was searching on google for quasar Barcode Readers, Generator and more, I could only found out a reader which was developer by Mr. Patrick. Finally, I tried to make it using vue-barcode plugin and It was not hard as I thought. With the ease of Quasar Framework, nothing will be impossible anymore.
